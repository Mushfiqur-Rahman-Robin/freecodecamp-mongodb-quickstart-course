This was my first introduction to mongoDB. During the learning process, I watched this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-1xI85Zog8) from Freecodecamp and tried to follow the instructions of Michael Kennedy. He taught this course by developing an application named Snake BnB. The codes in this repository was cloned from Michaels' github repo: https://github.com/mikeckennedy/mongodb-quickstart-course. I tried to understand how mongoDB and mongoengine works, what classes, document, embedded documents are in mongoDB. This course requires intermediate to advanced level Python knowledge, so you have to make sure that you have good enough knowledge in Python. Otherwise, this course may seem a bit tough and some concepts will be hard to get.
